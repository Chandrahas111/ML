In this project I have used the RandomForestRegressor model to predict the cost of a car based on the car data.csv.
For predicting the I have created a html template that runs in the server.



## HTML page
![car_price](https://github.com/Chandrahas111/ML/assets/143534361/2906fb5e-97fc-4bee-aef2-5e4e657ddcff)



This is the html page.
It takes the input of year, showroom price etc... and makes the good cost prediction.
## resource
The dataset is taken from kaggle Vehicle dataset.
