_In this project I have used the RandomForestRegressor model to predict the cost of a car based on the car data.csv.
For predicting the Ihave created a html template that runs in the server._



## HTML page
![car_price](https://github.com/Chandrahas111/ML/assets/143534361/2906fb5e-97fc-4bee-aef2-5e4e657ddcff)



_This is the html page.
It takes the input of year, showroom price etc... and makes the good cost prediction._
## resource
_The dataset is taken from kaggle [Vehicle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv)._
